TODO:
+ Authenticate with social network, display no results
+ Authenticate with social network, display a single URI
+ Authenticate with social network, display multiple URI
+ Sort URI into types: Video, Image, Other
+ Display final URI, for shortened links
+ Display URI with associated contact information

Nice to have:
+ Send to other social network 
+ Send to Instapaper
+ Send to Delicious?

Other:
+ Look into Cucumber/Webrat usage with Sinatra apps (RSpec book Ch.22)
+ Look at fake twitter service using WebMock or FakeWeb
+ Bam! Thoughtbot FTW. This will help me get a Fake Twitter going:

  - Potential problem: Fakes out Net::HTTP, so actually avoids full-stack testing (doesn't even used local network iface!)
+ Artifice looks pretty nice for faking a REST service: http://github.com/wycats/artifice
  Example: http://github.com/croaky/rack-oauth/blob/master/spec/spec_helper.rb
  - Seems to have the same problem as the above
+ VCR has a very quirky analogy (would probably need wrapping in any case) but records and plays back:
